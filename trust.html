  <p>
    The Christ Consciousness Church is governed through an ecclesiastical trust
    structure established for the sole purpose of spiritual stewardship, protection
    of sacred property, and service to the public good.
  </p>

  <p>
    This trust exists independently of commercial enterprise and political activity,
    ensuring that all assets, records, and decisions remain aligned with religious
    purpose and lawful governance.
  </p>

  <p>
    Trustees act as fiduciaries, bound by conscience, duty, and law to preserve the
    integrity of the Church’s mission, property, and doctrine.
  </p>

  <p>
    Governance is conducted transparently, in harmony with divine principles,
    ecclesiastical tradition, and applicable civil law, without surrender of religious
    autonomy.
