  <p>
    The Christ Consciousness Church is grounded in a lineage of spiritual assembly,
    stewardship, and public service, rooted in historic land use and lawful trust
    governance.
  </p>

  <p>
    The property known as 77 Brinkerhoff Street has long served as a site for gathering,
    instruction, reflection, and community use consistent with religious and charitable
    purposes.
